# Dashboard UI challenge
## Overview
***This is a challenge inspired by a friend who designed the same UI using Vue js. I had to pick up the challenge and use the three basic web development stack-HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT within 3 months of learning frontend development.***
## Features
***This is a frontend app and nothing complex happens in the backend. It is my first project that got so much validation in my journey through becoming a frontend developer but it has got pretty good features that make it a clean site:***
* The code is maintainable-I made sure I used simple codes to do complex things.
* It scores high in accessibility-I used proper html semantics to structure this coode making it score high in accessibility
* It is very responsive-I made sure it is responsive across all devices regardless of the width of such device.
* It has got a nice UI / UX
